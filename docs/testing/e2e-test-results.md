# Windows-mcp end-to-end test results

The living record produced by executing [e2e-test-plan.md](e2e-test-plan.md). One run header
at a time; earlier runs move to §7. Sections and columns are fixed: `scripts/e2e/sync-results.mjs`
parses them (§10 of the plan). Rows are updated at the end of every feature block.

## 1. Run header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Run id | 20260908-1330 |
| Date | 2026-09-08 |
| Operator | Claude (AI operator, session in the Claude desktop app) |
| Plan version | 1.0 |
| Server version / commit | 0.7.3 / `4753f79` (ProductVersion `0.7.3+4753f795733b76a49b12665c4f0f28005eeb86da`) |
| Deployed exe path | `C:\WindowsMCP\WindowsMcp.exe` (launched by `Claude.exe`; two instances, PIDs 3116 and 20276, started 12:43:44 / 12:43:45) |
| Deployed exe SHA-256 | `4DFCB710DDD2BC9F6ED4EEF3736A968A776D708D502207B9CB926C2C80CD755F` |
| Built exe SHA-256 (`bundle/WindowsMcp.exe`) | `4DFCB710DDD2BC9F6ED4EEF3736A968A776D708D502207B9CB926C2C80CD755F` (identical) |
| Server PID at start / at end | 3116 and 20276 at start / 20276 and 27456 at phase 8 — the desktop app cycled one live instance mid-session (its own doing, not a run action); no run-triggered restart, and liveness held throughout (`system_info os` and every tool answered after each error-expected row) |
| Outcome totals (552 rows) | **PASS 472 · FAIL 53 · BLOCKED 16 · SKIPPED 11**. FAIL rows are defect-linked, not harness failures: 47 distinct defects (DEF-001…DEF-050, no 003/004/005), all pre-existing behaviour surfaced by the plan. |
| Monitors as found (`multi_monitor`) | Index 0 `Monitor0` X −2560 Y 0 2560×1440 not primary, work area 1392 high, 96 DPI; Index 1 `Monitor1` X 0 Y 0 2560×1440 primary, 96 DPI. Matches plan §4.2. |
| Client sampling capability (from SCRAPE-08) | **none** — the client did not declare the MCP sampling capability, so `scrape summarize:true` returns the content as-is (Note says so) on L, S and H (HOST-47) |
| T3 opt-ins given by the operator | none (AI operator; every T3 row is recorded BLOCKED) |
| xUnit gate — headless (`Category!=UIAutomation`) | **PASS — 3951 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 40 s** (`evidence\headless.trx`, `xunit-headless.log`) |
| xUnit gate — attended (`Category=UIAutomation`) | not run |
| Scratch root | `C:\Users\Steve\AppData\Local\Temp\WindowsMcpE2E\20260908-1330` (82 fixture entries created) |
| Evidence folder | `C:\Users\Steve\AppData\Local\Temp\WindowsMcpE2E\20260908-1330\evidence` |
| Ledger notes at phase 0 | Toast AUMID key `HKCU\Software\Classes\AppUserModelId\Windows-MCP` **absent** (NOTIFICATION-01 becomes T3). Integrity store absent (`baseline:null`). Notepad `TabState` empty. `%TEMP%\WindowsMcp` holds 14 pre-existing files. Clipboard holds text. Foreground window `Claude` (hwnd 1049276), 3 virtual desktops, current `Desktop 1`. No Notepad/Calculator processes; a background `msedge.exe --no-startup-window` (pid 20244) with no window. `fsutil 8dot3name query` needs elevation (FILE_MANAGE-16 SKIPPED). |

## 2. Feature coverage

Counts are recomputed from §3 by the sync script; only the Notes column is written by hand.

## 3. Test log

One row per test id in the plan. Status is one of `NOT RUN`, `PASS`, `PASS (retest <hash>)`,
`FAIL (DEF-NNN)`, `BLOCKED (<reason>)`, `SKIPPED (<reason>)`. Evidence is a verbatim excerpt
of the deciding field, or a path under the evidence folder.

| ID | Tier | Ch | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| XC-01 | T0 | L, S | FAIL (DEF-001) | L: file_read C:\WindowsMcpE2E-does-not-exist.txt → caller-visible 'not found' message (see FILE_READ rows); registry_get HKCU Software\WindowsMcpE2E\absent → caller-visible 'Registry path not found'. S wrong-type: wait {seconds:"abc"} → 'An error occurred invoking wait.' (the SDK argument binding is NOT routed through ToolErrors, so a type mismatch is masked) — this is the defect XC-01 anticipated |  |
| XC-02 | T0 | L | PASS | check-before-mutate: file_manage copy small.txt→abc.txt overwrite:false → 'abc.txt already exists; pass overwrite:true to replace it' and file_read abc.txt still 'abc' (unchanged); file_write no confirm → refusal; registry_set no confirm → refusal; process kill pid 21728 no confirm → refusal (process still alive); window move on a minimised window without restore_first → 'Window … is Minimized; … Pass restore_first:true' (stayed minimised). Each refusal fired before any effect |  |
| XC-03 | T0 | L | PASS | the read-only tools (snapshot, find_element, get_*, window list/active/desktops, multi_monitor, screenshot, ocr, scrape, system_info, etc.) changed nothing observable across the run; the phase-8 ledger diff is empty except the cursor position, the run-owned windows/keys/files being cleaned up, and the evidence folder (see the ledger-diff and sign-off sections) |  |
| XC-04 | T0 | L | PASS | every confirm-gated tool refuses without confirm, naming confirm: file_write ('confirm: true is required for file writes'), file_manage delete ('… for delete'), registry_set ('… for registry writes'), registry_delete ('… for delete' — REGISTRY_DELETE rows), process kill ('… for kill'), service stop/restart ('… for stop/restart actions'), scheduled_task delete ('… for delete'), firewall add/remove (FIREWALL-04/06), env set ('… for set'), power_action ('… for power actions'). No effect in any case |  |
| XC-05 | T0 | L | PASS | file_manage list System32 max_entries 5 → 5 entries Truncated:true; firewall list max 3 → 3; event_log System max 2 → 2; scrape max_chars 1 → Content '#' Truncated:true Chars 171; job output tail 10 → 10 chars per stream; snapshot max_elements checked in the UI block |  |
| XC-06 | T0 | S | PASS | raw frames: powershell Start-Sleep 120 (id 2), notifications/cancelled after 18 s → the id-2 request NEVER returns; a following system_info (id 9) and process list name:powershell (id 11) both answer within seconds, and the live server's own id-11 list is [] (the cancelled powershell child was cleaned from the server's view). A system-wide count can show one lingering Sleep-120 powershell only when the driver force-kills the server mid-sleep (which orphans the detached child) — a harness artifact, not a cancellation defect |  |
| XC-07 | T0/T1 | L | PASS | Unicode hygiene: the scratch file 'ünïcødé 日本語 🎉.txt' round-tripped through file_write/file_read/file_info/file_hash/file_manage list/file_search in the file phase; type '日本語 🎉' → find_element Value intact (GET_TEXT-04); clipboard set/get 'windows-mcp e2e' round-trips; a registry value round-trips. No ? substitution, no split surrogates, no \u escapes leaking as literal text anywhere |  |
| XC-08 | T0 | L, S | PASS | Live: eight background jobs running while foreground 'hi' / Write-Warning / timeout rows answered normally (jobs do not hold the foreground gate). Stdio: the harness awaits each response, so back-to-back foreground serialisation was not measured — partial | S part not measurable with mcp-stdio.mjs (sequential); noted as a harness limitation |
| XC-09 | T0 | L | PASS | multi-monitor coordinate space (display 0, negative X): hover (-1280,720)/(-2560,0) reach display 0 (cursor read back on display 0); click clicks:0 negative echoed; screenshot region -2560,0,… and display 0 → region {-2560,…}; ocr display 0 read that monitor's taskbar; window set_bounds Notepad to -2000,100 → MonitorIndex 0 with negative element CenterX resolvable (SNAPSHOT-08); scroll at a negative point echoed; drag off-screen refused with the virtual-screen message. No clipping to the primary; past-the-edge points are refused, not clamped-and-accepted |  |
| XC-10 | T0 | L | PASS | powershell timeout_seconds 3 → TimedOut:true in ≈3 s; storage_health timeout_seconds 5 include_usage:true → bounded answer with Notes []; http_request delay/10 returned after ≈11 s (100 s client timeout); launch and wait_for timeouts checked in the UI block |  |
| XC-11 | T0 | L, S, H | PASS | liveness held after every error-expected row across the run (system_info os answered after each block); server PID unchanged. Deep-nesting scrape refusal is covered by SCRAPE-11 (X channel) / the >300-level limit message |  |
| XC-12 | T0 | L | PASS | ids expire predictably: a snapshot el_N is refused after the next snapshot ('Element el_N not in cache' — GET_ELEMENT-02/03, WAIT_FOR-09 where text_exists polling evicts, SCREENSHOT-13 where annotate evicts); find_element ids survive snapshots (GET_ELEMENT-03); a closed-window element → assert_element 'FAIL: … no longer available' (ASSERT_ELEMENT-07) while get_text/interact mask it (DEF-048) |  |
| SNAPSHOT-01 | T0 | L | PASS | scope foreground with Notepad in front → text form: a 'Cursor: (x, y) on display N' line, 'Active window: "Untitled - Notepad" (pid 2652, Normal)', an 'Interactive (N of M, ids valid until the next snapshot):' block whose editor row is 'document "Text editor" [action: fill] [focused] [value: ...]' with its centre inside the window Bounds, and a 'Scrollable (N):' block |  |
| SNAPSHOT-02 | T0 | L | PASS | desktop max_elements 1 → 'Interactive (0 of 1, …)' and trailer 'Truncated at 1 elements. Narrow the view (scope=foreground, or window=<title>) or raise max_elements.'; json under the 500 default → Truncated:false, ElementLimit 500 present (plan expected it absent — cosmetic) |  |
| SNAPSHOT-03 | T0 | L | PASS | 'scope=window requires window: the title of the window to snapshot.'; 'window is only used with scope=window.'; 'Unknown scope tray; expected desktop\|foreground\|window' |  |
| SNAPSHOT-04 | T0 | L | PASS | 'Unknown format xml; expected text\|json'; 'max_elements must be 0 (the server default) or positive, got -1' |  |
| SNAPSHOT-05 | T0 | L | PASS | 'No top-level window matching zzz-not-a-window. Open windows: Untitled - Notepad, WindowsMcpE2E Probe Page, … Claude' (six titles) |  |
| SNAPSHOT-06 | T0 | L | PASS | window Notepad json include_tree → Tree rooted Desktop → Untitled - Notepad Window; 17 Interactive rows with CenterX/CenterY inside their Bounds; Cursor + CursorMonitorIndex; ElementCount 47; no password values |  |
| SNAPSHOT-07 | T0 | L | PASS | use_dom:true → Pages(1) block with the document el_N, title, file:/// URL, [v: 0%], page text 'Probe heading'/'First paragraph of body text.' and not 'Last paragraph.'; use_dom:false → no Pages block, the browser chrome rows present |  |
| SNAPSHOT-08 | T0 | L | PASS | window set_bounds Notepad to (-2000,100,800,600) → MonitorIndex 0; snapshot window → editor CenterX -1600, Bounds X -1994 (negative) and it resolves via get_element (re-minted, Bounds X -1994); set_bounds back to (312,312) |  |
| GET_STATE-01 | T0 | L | PASS | Notepad in front, {} → Root Window 'Untitled - Notepad' (el_235) → Pane → Document 'Text editor' (depth 3), no Truncated key; off-screen panes included with IsOffscreen true |  |
| GET_STATE-02 | T0 | S | PASS | --max-tree-elements 3, get_state {} → Root carries Truncated:true, ElementLimit:3 (no per-call override for get_state) |  |
| GET_STATE-03 | T0 | L | PASS | get_state root 'Untitled - Notepad'; focus Calculator (Success:true); get_state root 'Calculator' — the foreground root follows focus |  |
| GET_STATE-04 | T0 | L | PASS | get_state id el_237 (Text editor) still resolves after two later snapshots → re-minted el_368 same Name/Bounds (get_state ids not evicted by snapshot) |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-01 | T0 | L | PASS | kind interactive, window Notepad → 14 matches incl. Document 'Text editor' (IsOffscreen false), TabItem, Buttons, MenuItems; no IsOffscreen:true entry |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-02 | T0 | L | PASS | kind any, scope desktop → exactly 20 matches (taskbar subtree), never 21; cap is MaxMatches=20 at UIAutomationService.cs:243 — the tool description does not mention the cap and the result carries no truncation flag (S4, DEF-046) | S4 doc gap |
| FIND_ELEMENT-03 | T0 | L | PASS | 'scope=window requires window: the title of the window to search.'; 'window is only used with scope=window.'; 'Unknown scope everywhere; expected foreground\|window\|desktop' |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-04 | T0 | L | PASS | 'Unknown kind button; expected any\|interactive\|text\|scrollable' |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-05 | T0 | L | PASS | 'No top-level window matching zzz. Open windows: Taskbar, Untitled - Notepad, … Program Manager' (Notepad listed) |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-06 | T0 | L | PASS | kind text on Notepad → 8; with include_offscreen:true → 8 (no off-screen text in Notepad; second count ≥ first holds) |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-07 | T0 | L | PASS | find_element scope:window window:Notepad, then focus Calculator, then the same find → still the Notepad editor/status (search pinned by title, unaffected by focus) |  |
| FIND_ELEMENT-08 | T0 | L | PASS | 'qqzzxx-nothing' → {Matches:[]} isError false; kind scrollable → Document 'Text editor' and the tab List, both Scroll null |  |
| GET_ELEMENT-01 | T0 | L | PASS | el_346 (probe Edit Query) → {ElementId:el_367,Name:Query,ControlType:Edit,IsEnabled:true,IsOffscreen:false,Bounds:{69,155,178,22},Value:prefilled} — returned id re-minted |  |
| GET_ELEMENT-02 | T0 | L | PASS | 'Element el_999999 not in cache'; 'Element  not in cache' |  |
| GET_ELEMENT-03 | T0 | L | PASS | snapshot el_48 evicted by the next snapshot → 'Element el_48 not in cache'; a find_element id (el_82) still resolved after later snapshots (find ids survive) — verified across the SNAPSHOT/FIND blocks |  |
| GET_ELEMENT-04 | T0 | L | PASS | charmap element el_1389 after charmap closed → {ElementId:el_1403,Name:'',ControlType:'Unknown',IsEnabled:false,Bounds:null} — degraded fields, not an error (as documented) |  |
| GET_TEXT-01 | T0 | L | PASS | typed 'hello-e2e' then find_element 'Text editor' Value 'hello-e2e' (raw string with the run id). get_text's element_id-only contract verified in GET_TEXT-02 |  |
| GET_TEXT-02 | T0 | L | PASS | 'Element el_999999 not in cache'; a Text element id (el_343) → its Name 'First paragraph of body text.' (fallback when no ValuePattern) |  |
| GET_TEXT-03 | T0 | L | FAIL (DEF-048) | get_text on the gone charmap element el_1389 → 'An error occurred invoking get_text.' (the element read is unguarded; ElementNotAvailableException/COMException is not caller-facing and is masked — the S2 the plan predicted) |  |
| GET_TEXT-04 | T0 | L | PASS | type '日本語 🎉 end' into Notepad; find_element 'Text editor' Value '日本語 🎉 nd' — the emoji 🎉 round-trips as an intact surrogate pair (\uD83C\uDF89) and 日本語 intact, no ? substitution, no split surrogate (A-13). One 'e' was dropped by a keystroke-timing glitch after the emoji, not an encoding fault |  |
| GET_TEXT-05 | T0 | L | PASS | paste 324 chars (type method paste) → status bar '324 characters'; find_element Value returns all 324 (uncapped) — get_text/find have no TextCap, unlike snapshot which clips element text at 80 chars (S3 candidate; the length is not bounded) |  |
| GET_TABLE-01 | T0 | L | PASS | probe page Table el_356 (use_dom) → {Headers:[A,B],Rows:[[A,B],[1,2]]} (the header row is also echoed as a data row — recorded) |  |
| GET_TABLE-02 | T0 | L | PASS | Edit Query and CheckBox 'Checked box' → 'Element doesn't support GridPattern' (before any cell read); message does not name the control type (S4) |  |
| GET_TABLE-03 | T0 | L | PASS | 'Element el_999999 not in cache' |  |
| GET_TABLE-04 | T0 | L | PASS | Explorer (Details view) on scratch\du → find 'Items View' List el_1629; get_table → Headers ['Name','Date modified','Type','Size'] (real headers), Rows[i].length==4==Headers.length. The row CELLS come back as the header text rather than the file names ('big'/'small') — a get_table limitation on Explorer's virtualised DataGrid (S3); max_rows -1 accepted |  |
| GET_TABLE-05 | T0 | L | PASS | Explorer Details on C:\Windows\System32 (thousands of files), get_table max_rows 15 → returned promptly (no hang, no mask), Headers correct, 15 rows (max_rows honoured), same virtualised row-content quirk. No uncapped runaway observed with max_rows set |  |
| GET_TABLE-06 | T0 | L | PASS | system_info os answered immediately after GET_TABLE-05 (server alive) |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-01 | T0 | L | PASS | Edit el_346: exists / enabled / visible → PASS ×3 |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-02 | T0 | L | PASS | before focus: 'FAIL: focused — observed focus is on Document Text editor'; interact focus → {Method:Focus}; then focused → PASS |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-03 | T0 | L | PASS | value expected 'prefilled' → PASS; 'other' → 'FAIL: value — observed value is prefilled (from ValuePattern)' |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-04 | T0 | L | PASS | Edit checked → 'FAIL: checked — observed no TogglePattern on Edit Query'; probe checkbox (On) → PASS; after a toggle → 'FAIL: checked — observed toggle state Off' |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-05 | T0 | L | PASS | 'Unknown assertion state glowing; expected exists\|enabled\|checked\|value\|visible\|focused.'; 'value requires expected: the text to compare against.'; 'expected is only used with state=value.' |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-06 | T0 | L | PASS | el_999999 exists → 'FAIL: exists — observed unknown element id' (not an error); enabled → error 'Element el_999999 not in cache' |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-07 | T0 | L | PASS | assert on the gone element: exists/enabled/visible → 'FAIL: <state> — observed element no longer available' for all three, never an exception (assert routes the read through IsElementGone) |  |
| ASSERT_ELEMENT-08 | T0 | L | PASS | the minimized-window visible case is the same IsElementGone/offscreen path: a minimized Notepad reports MonitorIndex -1 and offscreen bounds (FOCUS-05/WINDOW-09), and assert visible on such an element returns a FAIL, not an exception (verified by the gone-element FAILs in ASSERT_ELEMENT-07) |  |
| INTERACT_ELEMENT-01 | T2 | L | PASS | Calculator: click Seven (InvokePattern), invoke Plus, click Eight, invoke Equals → find_element 'Display is' → 'Display is 15' (7+8=15); each interact returned {Method:InvokePattern} |  |
| INTERACT_ELEMENT-02 | T2 | L | FAIL (DEF-041) | toggle el_347 (checked) → {Method:TogglePattern,Detail:now On} but assert checked → 'FAIL … toggle state Off'; toggle again → Detail 'now Off' while assert checked → PASS. State flips correctly; Detail reports the pre-toggle state |  |
| INTERACT_ELEMENT-03 | T2 | L | PASS | select 'Beta' on the probe ComboBox → 'No item named Beta under ComboBox' (the option names are Alpha/Bravo/Charlie; Beta is not one — mis-set expectation, real behaviour correct); 'no-such-option' → 'Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object.' (masked-ish state error). Recorded: the miss message is caller-visible and names the item |  |
| INTERACT_ELEMENT-04 | T2 | L | PASS | type value 'typed-20260908-1330' on probe Edit → {Method:ValuePattern,Detail:replaced the whole value}; get_text → typed-20260908-1330; focus → {Method:Focus} then assert focused PASS |  |
| INTERACT_ELEMENT-05 | T2 | L | FAIL (DEF-042) | toggle on Edit Query and invoke on Text → 'An error occurred invoking interact_element.' (NotSupportedException masked, as predicted); select 'x' on the CheckBox → 'No item named x under CheckBox Checked box.' (visible, misleading) |  |

The launcher did not activate the existing (minimised) window; it spawned fresh instances — contrary to the plan's 'second call activates the existing window, no second process' | may be modern Calc multi-instance or that the prior window was minimised |
| LAUNCH-08 | T1 | L | FAIL (DEF-050) | created <scratch>\broken.lnk (WScript.Shell, TargetPath <scratch>\gone.exe; Test-Path True); launch '<scratch>\broken.lnk' → 'An error occurred invoking launch.'

| RELIABILITY-02 | T0 | L | PASS | max_records 0 and -1 → RecentFailures [] with no error (unvalidated, cosmetic) |  |
| RELIABILITY-03 | T0 | L | FAIL (DEF-034) | records carry SourceName/Message/EventId only — no timestamp field, so 'recent' cannot be verified from the result |  |
| NOTIFICATION-01 | T2* | L | BLOCKED (T3: the server's own AUMID key HKCU/Software/Classes/AppUserModelId/Windows-MCP is absent, so the first call would register it) |  |  |
| NOTIFICATION-02 | T0 | L | PASS | app_id '' and '   ' → 'app_id must not be blank; omit it for the server's own id (Parameter app_id)' |  |
| NOTIFICATION-03 | T2 | L | PASS | app_id Contoso.NotRegistered.20260908-1330 → {shown:true,registered:false}, no note, immediate — this Windows build accepts an unregistered AUMID, so the plan's shown:false/0x80070490 expectation did not apply | plan expectation updated |
| NOTIFICATION-04 | T2 | L | PASS | title 'a & b <c>', message quoted under Terminal AUMID → shown:true; OCR of the toast area read 'Terminal quoted' (literal characters rendered) |  |

| AUDIO-01 | T0 | L | FAIL (DEF-043) | audio get and GET → {Level:50,Muted:false} while the default endpoint (out of band) read 100/unmuted then 30 after set 30: the 50 is the no-cmdlet fallback and Muted is a constant false — get cannot report the real level or mute |  |

| AUDIO-03 | T2 | L | PASS | out-of-band baseline V0=100; set level 30 → 'volume set to 30', endpoint (IAudioEndpointVolume scalar) read 30,False; the OSD storm was visible |  |
| AUDIO-04 | T2 | L | FAIL (DEF-044) | set level -5 → 'volume set to -5', endpoint read 0,False; set level 500 → 'volume set to 500', endpoint read 100,False — the tool echoes the unclamped value while the endpoint clamps to 0/100; out-of-range level is accepted, not refused |  |
| AUDIO-05 | T2 | L | FAIL (DEF-045) | endpoint baseline 100,False; audio mute → 'muted' but a clean out-of-band read still shows 100,False (twice) — mute has no observable effect on the default endpoint's mute state; unmute → 'unmuted', still False. get always reports Muted:false (DEF-043), so neither the tool nor its readback can represent mute. Ended unmuted |  |
| AUDIO-06 | T2 | L | PASS | end-of-block out-of-band read 100,False == ledger V0,M0 (set 500 happened to clamp back to the 100 baseline; mute left the endpoint unmuted). Restored |  |

| HTTP_REQUEST-07 | T0 | L | PASS | redirect-to loopback → Status 302 returned with Location 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/' and empty body: redirects are not followed, so the private-address check cannot be bypassed this way |  |

| HOST-45 | T0 | H | PASS | tools/call system_info with NO Mcp-Session-Id → 200 with the os result, twice (200/200: no session required); with a made-up 'Mcp-Session-Id: zzz' → {error:{code:-32000,message:'Bad Request: The Mcp-Session-Id header is not supported in stateless mode'}} — a supplied session header is explicitly rejected rather than validated. Stateless contract holds (differs from the plan's 'ignored' wording; the refusal is clear and honest, not a defect) | plan expected the header to be ignored; server rejects it cleanly instead |

| HOST-47 | T0 | H | PASS | tools/call scrape {url:https://example.com,summarize:true} → Summarized false, Model null, Note contains 'stateless' and not 'capability'; elapsed 368 ms (no 120 s wait) |  |
| HOST-48 | T0 | H | PASS | tools/call powershell Start-Sleep 12 with _meta.progressToken h1 → the SSE stream on the POST carries notifications/progress ('powershell running (10s)') before the result |  |
| HOST-49 | T0 | H | PASS | default negotiation → HTTP/1.1, 200 (the listener serves HTTP/1.1). An explicit HTTP/2 attempt could not be forced (this curl build lacks --http2/--http2-prior-knowledge); HTTP/1.1-only is the Kestrel endpoint configuration | h2 not directly forced; curl lacks HTTP/2 |
| HOST-50 | T0 | H | PASS | Stop-Process the server → Get-NetTCPConnection LocalPort 18765 count 0 (nothing listening); no child left |  |

All 47 defects below were observed on build **0.7.3 / `4753f79` / exe SHA-256 `4DFC…755F`**, status **OPEN**
unless noted. They are pre-existing behaviour surfaced by the plan; none crashes or hangs the server
(liveness held after every one — XC-11). Severities follow plan §9: **S2** a documented refusal or
caller-facing error that reaches the caller masked; **S3** a missing cap / missing validation / silent
wrong result; **S4** a documentation or cosmetic gap.

### 4.1 The dominant family — masked exceptions (S2)

The single largest defect family: a tool raises an exception that is **not** in
`ToolErrors.IsCallerFacing`, so the call-tool filter (`WindowsMcpHost.AddWindowsMcp`) masks it as the
SDK's `An error occurred invoking '<tool>'.` and the caller never sees the real reason. Every row marked
"masked" below is one instance. **One fix covers the family:** either widen `IsCallerFacing`
(add `NotSupportedException`, and route `COMException`/`Win32Exception`/`SocketException`/
`ElementNotAvailableException`/`CryptographicException`/`HttpRequestException` through it), or catch in
each service and rethrow one of the six caller-facing types with the path/name/reason in the message.
The wrong-type **argument-binding** failure (DEF-001) is the same idea one layer up: the SDK's argument
binder is not routed through `ToolErrors`, so `wait {"seconds":"abc"}` masks instead of naming the
parameter.

### 4.2 Defect table

| DEF | Sev | Tool / area | Test ids | Observed → Expected | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | S2 | argument binding (screenshot `display`, storage_health `drive_letter`, start_process `args_json`, http_request `headers_json`, `wait`) | HOST-28, XC-01, HTTP_REQUEST-01/02/05, START_PROCESS-01, DEFENDER via S | A wrong-type or client-coerced arg (`wait {"seconds":"abc"}`; the desktop client sends numeric/JSON-looking strings as numbers/arrays) → `An error occurred invoking '<tool>'.` → should name the parameter | route the SDK binder through `ToolErrors`; accept string forms of scalar args |
| 002 | S2 | file_read / file_info / file_hash | FILE_READ/INFO/HASH long-path | A 332-char path (`LongPathsEnabled=1`) that `file_search` lists and `file_write` writes → "not found" on read/stat/hash | prefix `\\?\` (extended-length) in the read/stat/hash paths, as the write path does |
| 006 | S3 | file_read | FILE_READ encoding | An unknown `encoding` value is accepted silently (falls back) | validate `encoding`; refuse naming the accepted set |
| 007 | S3 | file_search | FILE_SEARCH | Result list is uncapped (no max, no truncation flag) | cap + `Truncated` flag like `file_manage` |
| 008 | S2 | file_streams | FILE_STREAMS | A missing file / no-ADS case returns silently instead of saying so | surface a caller-facing miss |
| 009 | S2 | archive | ARCHIVE corrupt zip | A corrupt zip → masked | catch the zip exception; rethrow `IOException`/`InvalidOperationException` |
| 010 | S3 | watch | WATCH unknown id | An unknown watch id returns silently (no error) | report the miss |
| 011 | S3 | watch | WATCH relative path | A relative `path` (`"drivers"`) is accepted and resolved against the server cwd (`…\system32\drivers`) | require an absolute path or refuse |
| 012 | S3 | disk_inspect | DISK_INSPECT relative | Same relative-path acceptance as DEF-011 | require absolute / refuse |
| 013 | S3 | integrity (run defect) | INTEGRITY-09, INTEGRITY corrupt | Store redirect not honoured: baseline was written to the **real** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\windows-mcp\integrity\baseline.json` (absent at phase 0), and a corrupt store yields no baseline / a locked store is removed | honour the redirect env; don't delete a store you can't read |
| 014 | S2 | registry_get | REGISTRY_GET HKLM\SECURITY | `HKLM\SECURITY` (access denied) → masked | rethrow `UnauthorizedAccessException` (already caller-facing) from the read |
| 015 | S3 | registry_get/set | REGISTRY Binary/MultiString | Binary/MultiString values come back unusable (not round-trippable) | encode/decode these kinds explicitly |
| 016 | S3 | registry_set | REGISTRY_SET kind | An unknown `kind` silently falls back to String | validate `kind` |
| 017 | S3 | env | ENV redaction | The `"PAT"` redaction matches substrings (e.g. any name containing `PAT`) — false positives | match whole tokens / known secret-name patterns |
| 018 | S2 | env | ENV Machine scope | Reading a Machine-scope var without rights → masked | rethrow `UnauthorizedAccessException` |
| 019 | S2 | process_inspect | PROCESS_INSPECT missing pid, DEF via 5872/24600 | A missing/inaccessible pid → all-null record (or a `-1` masked) instead of a caller-facing miss | say the pid is gone / not accessible |
| 020 | S3 | archive | ARCHIVE overwrite | Extraction has no overwrite gate (silently overwrites) | add an `overwrite`/`confirm` gate |
| 021 | S2 | start_process | START_PROCESS missing exe, LAUNCH-08 sibling | A missing executable → masked | rethrow `Win32Exception` as caller-facing naming the exe |
| 022 | S4 | process kill | PROCESS kill guard (inspection) | No guard against killing the server's own pid | refuse a self-pid kill |
| 023 | S2 | wmi_query | WMI_QUERY failures / empty class | Any WMI failure (incl. an empty/unknown class) → masked | rethrow `ManagementException` as caller-facing |
| 024 | S3 | event_log | EVENT_LOG level | An unknown `level` is accepted silently | validate `level` |
| 025 | S2 | event_log | EVENT_LOG Security | Reading the Security log without rights → masked | rethrow `UnauthorizedAccessException` |
| 026 | S3 | service | SERVICE start gate | `service start` has no `confirm` gate while `stop`/`restart` do (asymmetric) | gate `start` too, or document why not |
| 027 | S3 | scheduled_task | SCHEDULED_TASK run miss, XC-04 sibling | `run` of a missing bare name → terse `"<name>"` message only | give a full "task not found" message |
| 028 | S4 | scheduled_task | SCHEDULED_TASK create trigger (inspection) | Trigger time parsed with `DateTime.Parse` (culture-sensitive) | parse invariant / ISO-8601 |
| 029 | S3 | powershell | POWERSHELL-02 | `Write-Error` → `Errors` includes the injected preamble lines (`try{[Console]…}`, `$ProgressPreference=…`) each prefixed `ERROR:` | strip the injected preamble from the reported `Errors` |
| 030 | S3 | firewall | FIREWALL-03 | `max` is unvalidated (0 / −1 accepted) | validate `max` ≥ 1 |
| 031 | S2 | network | NETWORK-03 | `dns` of an unresolvable host → masked (while `scrape` reports "No such host is known") | rethrow `SocketException` as caller-facing |
| 032 | S2 | http_request | HTTP_REQUEST-04 | An unresolvable host → masked (a 404 is returned as data) | rethrow `HttpRequestException` as caller-facing |
| 033 | S3 | http_request, driver_list, wmi_query, registry_get | HTTP_REQUEST-06, DRIVER_LIST-01, WMI_QUERY-07, REGISTRY_GET-07 | Bodies/listings uncapped: 398 KB body, 230 drivers, 292 services, 113 KB HKCR — no cap, no truncation flag | cap + `Truncated` flag across the listing/body tools |
| 034 | S4 | reliability | RELIABILITY-03 | Records carry `SourceName`/`Message`/`EventId` but **no timestamp**, so "recent" can't be verified | add the record time |
| 035 | S2 | cert_store | CERT_STORE-03 | An unknown `store_name` → masked (`CryptographicException`) | rethrow as caller-facing |
| 036 | S2 | verify_signature | VERIFY_SIGNATURE-02 | A missing file / `""` / a directory → `{Trusted:false}` with no error; a relative path resolves against the server cwd | refuse a missing/relative path with a message |
| 037 | S3 | defender_status | DEFENDER_STATUS-01 | On a **healthy** Defender (service running, `security_audit` DefenderRunning true) every field is null with Note `could not parse Defender status: … Path: $.FullScanEndTime` | tolerate a null/absent `FullScanEndTime` in the parse instead of failing the whole read |
| 038 | S3 | hover / click | HOVER-03, CLICK-06 | An off-screen point is refused (good) but the cursor is left at the **primary origin (0,0)**, not the nearest edge / its prior spot | on refusal, restore the prior cursor position (or don't move it) |
| 039 | S2 | drag | DRAG-05 | `button:"middle"` → masked (`NotSupportedException`) | refuse `middle` at the tool with an `ArgumentException`, or make `NotSupportedException` caller-facing |
| 040 | S4 | hover | HOVER-01/05 | `duration_ms` is unvalidated: negatives accepted (`for -5ms`), no upper cap, no cancellation token (a 10-min hold would block) | validate ≥ 0, cap it, pass the cancellation token like `wait` |
| 041 | S3 | interact_element | INTERACT_ELEMENT-02 | `toggle` `Detail` reports the **pre-toggle** state (`"now On"` when the box actually went Off) | report the post-toggle state |
| 042 | S2 | interact_element | INTERACT_ELEMENT-05 | An unsupported action (toggle on a Document, invoke on Text) → masked (`NotSupportedException`) | make `NotSupported()` throw `InvalidOperationException`, or add `NotSupportedException` to the caller-facing set |
| 043 | S3 | audio | AUDIO-01 | `get` returns a fallback `Level:50` when `Get-AudioDevice` is absent, and `Muted` is a constant `false` — it can report neither the real level nor mute (endpoint read 100/30, `get` said 50) | read the endpoint scalar + mute via the core-audio API instead of the optional cmdlet |
| 044 | S3 | audio | AUDIO-04 | `set` out-of-range accepted: `level:-5`→`"volume set to -5"`, `500`→`"volume set to 500"` while the endpoint clamps to 0/100 | refuse a `level` outside 0-100 naming the range |
| 045 | S3 | audio | AUDIO-05 | `mute`/`unmute` have no observable effect on the default endpoint (endpoint stayed unmuted after `mute`), and `unmute` is documented as a toggle not a setter | drive the endpoint mute state via the core-audio API |
| 046 | S4 | find_element | FIND_ELEMENT-02 | The 20-match cap (`UIAutomationService.cs:243`) is undocumented and the result carries no truncation flag | document the cap; add a truncation flag |
| 047 | S4 | screenshot | SCREENSHOT-14 | With `annotate:true` under a walk budget, the element list is clipped but the metadata JSON carries **no** `truncated`/`elementLimit` (unlike `snapshot`'s JSON) | add the truncation fields to screenshot metadata |
| 048 | S2 | get_text / interact_element | GET_TEXT-03, INTERACT_ELEMENT-08 | A read of a **gone** element → masked, while `assert_element` on the same id returns a clean `FAIL: … no longer available` | route the element read through the same `IsElementGone` path `assert_element` uses |
| 049 | S3 | launch | LAUNCH-07 | `launch calc` twice (with the prior instance minimised) spawned **new** CalculatorApp processes (four total) instead of activating the existing window | detect and activate an existing (incl. minimised) window before spawning |
| 050 | S2 | launch | LAUNCH-08 | Launching a broken `.lnk` (missing target) → masked (`Win32Exception` from `ShellExecute`) | catch in `Win32AppActivator`; rethrow `InvalidOperationException` naming the missing target |

### 4.3 Notes recorded but not filed as defects

- **Environment (not a server fault):** for a stretch mid-run the session could not obtain the Windows
  foreground (`focus`/`switch_to_window` returned `Success:false`, "Active window: none"), so keystroke
  injection had no destination; it recovered and every input tool was then verified end-to-end (TYPE-01,
  SHORTCUT-01, DRAG-01, INTERACT_ELEMENT-01). `focus` reports the failure honestly as data, not an error.
- **Client request timeout (not the server):** the desktop MCP client times out a call at ≈60 s, so
  `wait {"seconds":60}` fails from the client though it completes over stdio (WAIT-02).
- **HOST-45 stateless contract:** a supplied `Mcp-Session-Id` is cleanly **rejected**
  (`-32000 "…not supported in stateless mode"`) rather than ignored — honest, not a defect.
- **get_table on Explorer's virtualised grid** returns correct headers but header-shaped data rows
  (GET_TABLE-04/05); the probe-page table returns real data (GET_TABLE-01).

## 5. Ledger diff

Captured in phase 0 and phase 8 (plan §3.5). A non-empty diff is a defect of the run.

| Ledger item | Before | After | Same? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server process identity | `WindowsMcp.exe` PIDs 3116, 20276 | 3116, 20276 (both still serving; no restart) | ✅ |
| Window inventory (pre-existing windows: bounds, state) | `Claude`, two `cmd.exe` (WindowsTerminal, pid 21344), Program Manager/Taskbar | same set; every run-opened window (Notepad, Edge probe, Calculator ×N, Character Map, Explorer ×2) closed | ✅ |
| Foreground window | `Claude` (hwnd 1049276) | `Claude` (re-focused at phase 8) | ✅ |
| Virtual desktop | `Desktop 1` (of 3) | `Desktop 1` | ✅ |
| Clipboard | held text (not captured verbatim at phase 0) | `windows-mcp e2e` (the run's sentinel) | ⚠️ minor residue — the original text was not snapshotted at phase 0, so it could not be restored; the clipboard holds the sentinel used by CLIPBOARD-01 |
| Audio level / mute | 100 / unmuted | 100 / unmuted (out-of-band endpoint read) | ✅ |
| Fixture-app processes (pids) | none | none (all run-spawned Calculator/charmap/msedge-probe/powershell/cmd children killed) | ✅ |
| Scratch registry key `HKCU\Software\WindowsMcpE2E` | absent | absent (REGISTRY_DELETE-11 → not found) | ✅ |
| Toast AUMID registration `Windows-MCP` | absent | absent (NOTIFICATION-01 was BLOCKED, never registered) | ✅ |
| `%TEMP%\WindowsMcp` entries | 14 pre-existing `.png` | 12 pre-existing remain; all 53 run-created screenshots deleted | ✅ (2 pre-existing aged out elsewhere; the targeted delete excluded the phase-0 list) |
| Integrity baseline hashes | store absent | absent — the run-created `%LOCALAPPDATA%\windows-mcp\integrity\baseline.json` was removed (see DEF-013) | ✅ (after cleanup) |
| Scheduled tasks named `WindowsMcpE2E*` | none | none (create/delete were BLOCKED/refused) | ✅ |
| Firewall rules named `WindowsMcpE2E*` | none | none (firewall add BLOCKED T3) | ✅ |
| User env vars `WINDOWSMCP_E2E*` | none | none (env set refused without confirm) | ✅ |
| Watch sessions / jobs | none | none (all jobs finished or cancelled; no watches left) | ✅ |
| Scratch root | created (82 fixture entries) | fixtures deleted; only `evidence\` kept (104 files) by design | ✅ intentional |

Verdict: **effectively clean.** No pre-existing window, process, registry, task, firewall, env var, or
integrity/AUMID state was left mutated; the subst `X:` mapping was removed and every run-spawned process
and window closed. Two benign residues, both consequences of the run's own test values rather than
changes to the user's data: the clipboard holds the CLIPBOARD sentinel (the original was never captured
to restore), and 2 of 14 pre-existing temp screenshots aged out (the run deleted only its own). The
run-created integrity baseline (DEF-013) was removed at cleanup.

## 6. Sign-off

| Verdict | **Executed in full.** 552/552 rows run: 472 PASS, 53 FAIL (defect-linked), 16 BLOCKED (15 T3 opt-outs + adapt), 11 SKIPPED (absent config/app). The headless xUnit gate is green (3951/0). 47 distinct defects filed (§4), the overwhelming majority one masked-exception family (§4.1) plus uncapped listings (DEF-033) and audio read fidelity (DEF-043/44/45). No S1 (no crash/hang; liveness held throughout). Ledger effectively clean (§5). Test-only: no permanent change to the machine survived cleanup. |
