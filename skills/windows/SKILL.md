# Windows

A judgment layer over the `windows-mcp` server's 69 atomic tools for Windows desktop automation and system inspection — UI driving, screenshots/OCR, files, registry, services, processes, disk, network, and security/startup analysis. This skill adds no tools of its own: every action below is one of the server's existing MCP tools, composed into the right order with the right safety checks. Its job is to steer tool selection (MCP vs. raw PowerShell), sequence multi-step workflows correctly, and flag which tools are destructive enough to need confirmation first.

**Skill root**: this skill ships inside the `windows-mcp` plugin (repo
`Steven23456/Windows-mcp`, `skills/windows/`). Slash trigger: `/windows`.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user wants any of:

- **Drive a GUI application** — click, type, read UI state, wait for elements to appear
- **Capture or read the screen** — screenshot, OCR a region, extract text/tables from a UI element
- **Diagnose slow boot / startup bloat** — "why is my PC slow to start", "audit autoruns"
- **Clean up processes** — "what's eating memory", "kill orphaned processes" (whitelist-only, never kill-all)
- **Check security posture** — Defender status, firewall rules, certificate trust, a full security audit
- **Inspect or modify system state** — registry values, services, scheduled tasks, environment variables
- **File forensics** — locate, hash, inspect metadata/streams, or verify the signature of a file
- **Disk/network diagnostics** — disk usage vs. drive health, adapters/ports/DNS/ping

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Cross-platform automation (this server and its tools are Windows-only)
- Anything requiring elevation the user hasn't granted — the server itself runs unelevated (see Section 5)

## Tool selection: windows-mcp tools vs. raw PowerShell

**Default to the MCP tool.** It is faster than a PowerShell cold-start, returns structured JSON instead of text to parse, and runs unelevated in one consistent place. Reach for raw PowerShell only when none of the 69 tools express what's needed.

**Fall back to the `powershell` tool** only for one-off scripting the 69 tools don't cover. Multi-line scripts are fine — the tool passes the script as one unit. For anything that may run longer than a few minutes (installers, `DISM`, bulk hashes) pass `background: true` and poll with `job`.

The MCP server **runs unelevated**. Admin-only operations — `registry_set` under `HKLM`, `service` start/stop, some `scheduled_task` actions — can return access-denied. Recognize that signature and surface it to the user instead of retrying blindly; the skill cannot grant elevation it doesn't have.

| The task | Reach for |
|---|---|
| Inspect OS/memory/disk/GPU/battery | `system_info`, `wmi_query` |
| List/inspect/kill a process | `process`, `process_inspect` |
| Read/search/hash a file | `file_read`, `file_search`, `file_hash`, `file_info` |
| Read a registry value | `registry_get` |
| Drive a GUI app | `snapshot` → `interact_element`/`click`/`type` → `assert_element` |
| One-off scripting no tool covers | `powershell` (`background: true` for long runs, then `job`) |

If a `windows-mcp` tool isn't loaded, fetch its schema via `ToolSearch select:mcp__plugin_windows-mcp_Windows-mcp__<tool>`.

## The 69 tools, grouped by domain

**UI automation / input (29)** — drive and read the desktop and its GUI applications: `snapshot`, `click`, `drag`, `hover`, `key`, `shortcut`, `type`, `scroll`, `focus`, `get_state`, `get_element`, `get_text`, `get_table`, `find_element`, `assert_element`, `interact_element`, `multi_select`, `multi_edit`, `wait`, `wait_for`, `switch_to_window`, `window`, `multi_monitor`, `screenshot`, `ocr`, `clipboard`, `file_dialog`, `notification`, `launch`

**Processes / shell (5)** — enumerate, inspect, start, or kill processes; run arbitrary scripts: `process`, `process_inspect`, `start_process`, `powershell` (with `background: true` for long-running jobs), `job`

**System (7)** — machine-level inspection and power control: `system_info`, `wmi_query`, `env`, `reliability`, `event_log`, `driver_list`, `power_action`

**Files (7)** — read, write, search, and forensically inspect files: `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_manage`, `file_search`, `file_info`, `file_hash`, `file_streams`. Absolute paths only — a relative one is refused naming the parameter. `file_read` pages a large file with `offset_lines`/`limit_lines` instead of raising `max_bytes`; `file_write` takes `append`; `file_manage` refuses an existing copy/move destination without `overwrite: true` and a non-empty directory delete without `recursive: true`, and its `list` returns `{Path, Name, IsDirectory, Size, Modified, Hidden}` entries (`pattern` glob, `recursive`, `include_hidden`)

**Disk / storage (2)** — usage vs. drive health: `disk_inspect`, `storage_health`

**Services / tasks (2)** — Windows services and scheduled tasks: `service`, `scheduled_task`

**Registry (3)** — read, write, and delete registry values and keys: `registry_get`, `registry_set`, `registry_delete`

**Network / web (4)** — connectivity and HTTP: `network`, `firewall`, `http_request`, `scrape`

**Security (5)** — trust and posture checks: `security_audit`, `defender_status`, `cert_store`, `verify_signature`, `startup_report`

**Monitoring / integrity (3)** — file-integrity tripwire, NTFS USN change journal, and live directory watching: `integrity`, `fs_changes`, `watch`

**Misc (2)** — utility operations: `archive`, `audio`

(29+5+7+7+2+2+3+4+5+3+2 = 69.) If a `windows-mcp` tool isn't loaded, fetch its schema via `ToolSearch select:mcp__plugin_windows-mcp_Windows-mcp__<tool>`.

## Workflow playbooks

### 1. Startup / boot-slowness triage

```
startup_report
  → for each suspicious entry:
      verify_signature + cert_store    (is it signed / trusted?)
      reliability + event_log          (recent crashes/hangs, boot/service errors)
```

`startup_report` gives a HiJackThis-style read-only inventory of autoruns, startup folders, services, and shell extensions, each already carrying a catalog-aware trust flag — start there rather than re-deriving it. For anything unsigned, untrusted, or unfamiliar, cross-check `verify_signature`/`cert_store` directly, then corroborate with `reliability` (crash minidumps and failure records) and `event_log` (boot/service errors). Decision: unsigned or untrusted autoruns that line up with recent reliability drops are the prime suspects.

### 2. Process cleanup (whitelist — never kill-all)

```
process (action: orphans)                     — recycle-aware orphans + signals, one call
  → (or) process (action: list, sort_by: "cpu", limit: 20)   — what is eating the CPU, top 20
  → (or) process (action: list, groupByRoot: true)   — see which root spawned a pile
  → process (action: kill, pid, confirm: true[, graceful: true][, tree: true][, startTime])
```

Prefer `action: orphans` (or `list` with `includeLineage: true`) over the old `list → process_inspect` dance — it returns parent lineage, command line, `ageMinutes`, `runtimeKind`, `orphaned`, and `isSystemAdjacent` for every process in a single call, so you can rank candidates without inspecting each one. `groupByRoot: true` collapses processes under their root ancestor — the fast way to see, e.g., five stale sessions each holding a server fleet. **Read the signals, don't trust the label:** `orphaned` is COMMON and by-design on Windows (`explorer.exe` and anything launched from a since-closed shell are orphaned) — it is NOT a leak signal; `isSystemAdjacent: true` flags the boot/session processes to leave alone. **Hard rail:** never terminate `csrss`, `wininit`, `winlogon`, `services`, `lsass`, `explorer`, or any user-facing application. To reap a stale session and its whole fleet in one guarded call, use `kill` with `tree: true` (kills the pid + its descendants, each re-validated before killing) and pass `startTime` to guard against PID reuse. Always confirm the kill list with the user; `confirm: true` is required. **Prefer `graceful: true` for anything with a window** — it posts `WM_CLOSE` to the process's visible windows, waits `grace_ms` (default 3000, max 60000) and only then forces it, so an editor gets to raise its "save changes?" prompt; the result says `exitedGracefully` or `forced` per pid, a windowless process is forced at once, and `graceful` cannot be combined with `tree`. For "what is eating the CPU", the plain `list` carries `CpuPercent` (normalised across all cores, like Task Manager) with `sort_by: "cpu"` and `limit` — neither applies to `orphans`/`includeLineage`/`groupByRoot`, which refuse them.

### 3. Security audit sweep

```
security_audit + defender_status + firewall (action: list) + startup_report
```

Run all four and compose the results into one health summary with a per-area verdict (firewall, Defender/AV, UAC/BitLocker where available, and autorun/startup hygiene). Note that `security_audit`'s admin-gated fields (BitLocker, some firewall profiles) return null when run unelevated — report those as "unknown," not "failed."

### 4. UI-automation loop

```
snapshot                                    (windows, cursor, every el_N with a centre + action)
  → interact_element / click / type / key   (act, using the el_N ids or their centres)
  → assert_element / wait_for               (confirm the state changed)
  → wait                                    (only when nothing is assertable: a fixed pause)
  → snapshot                                (re-read: ids are stale after acting)
  → repeat
```

**Start the loop with `snapshot`.** One call returns what used to take `window(action:"list")` + `get_state` + a `find_element` per control: the z-ordered window list, the active window, the cursor, and every interactive element as a row `el_N (x,y) type "name" [action: …]` — the centre coordinates are virtual-desktop pixels `click`/`drag`/`scroll` take unchanged (or pass the `el_N` id itself and let them resolve the centre), and the action tag (`click`/`fill`/`toggle`/`select`/`slide`/`scroll`) says which verb the control expects. Scrollable regions follow with their `[v: N%] [h: N%]` and a `[reached top]`/`[reached bottom]` tag. The default output is compact text; ask for `format:"json"` only when something must be parsed (`include_tree:true` adds the element tree there).

Pass those `el_N` ids straight to `interact_element`, `get_element`, `get_text`, `click`, `type`, `scroll` and `drag`, or click the printed centre. **The ids are only valid until the next `snapshot`** — a new one evicts the previous one's ids (an id from `find_element` in between survives, and a `screenshot(annotate:true)` walks the desktop too, so it evicts them as well), so re-snapshot after acting rather than reusing a row from two turns ago. Read, act, confirm, re-read; don't chain blind actions.

**Never sleep through the `powershell` tool.** Between an action and the next `snapshot`, use `wait` (`seconds`, more than 0 and at most 60, fractions allowed) — it pauses in-process, costs no PowerShell cold start and doesn't take the serialization gate. Prefer `wait_for` whenever the thing you are waiting on is *observable* (an element appearing): it polls and returns as soon as the condition holds instead of burning a fixed pause, and it is the right call for anything longer than a minute. `wait` is the fallback for the un-assertable — an animation settling, a splash screen, a save that shows no new control.

**`wait_for` waits for a *condition*, not just an element.** `condition:"element_exists"` (the default) and `"element_enabled"` poll `find_element` with the usual `kind`/`scope`/`window`/`include_offscreen` filters; `"focused_element"` waits until the element holding keyboard focus is the one you name; `"text_exists"` waits for the text to turn up anywhere in a snapshot of the scope — element names and values and scrollable regions, plus the web page's own words with `use_dom:true`; `"active_window"` waits for the foreground window's title to match (exact → substring → fuzzy ≥ 70) and reads only the window inventory, so it costs no element walk. The short aliases `element`, `enabled`, `focused`, `text` and `window` are accepted. `timeout_ms` is 0–120000 (0 = check once, now) and `interval_ms` 0–5000. **The call always returns `{Satisfied, Condition, ElapsedMs, Attempts, Detail, Element?}`, and a timeout is `Satisfied:false` — not an error and not the old `"null"` string:** read `Detail` for what was seen instead (or `every poll failed: …` when no poll ever got a look) and decide from that rather than retrying blind. After `launch`, `wait_for(condition:"active_window", text:"Notepad")` is the cheapest way to know the app is really in front; after a navigation, `wait_for(condition:"text_exists", text:"Order confirmed", use_dom:true)` is the cheapest way to know the page loaded.

Narrow the view when the desktop is busy: `scope:"foreground"`, or `scope:"window"` with `window:<title>` (exact then substring). If the footer says the walk was truncated, narrow the scope or raise `max_elements` (the default budget is the server's `--max-tree-elements`, 500). **The target app must be on an interactive desktop, and a minimised window is listed but not walked.** Prefer element ids over hardcoded coordinates, which break when the window moves or resizes. `get_state` remains for the raw three-level JSON tree of the foreground window; `snapshot` is the cheaper read for driving the UI.

**For a web page, add `use_dom:true`.** Every Chromium browser window in scope (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) is then walked from the page itself — the `RootWebArea` document — instead of the whole window, so the address bar, tab strip and toolbar buttons drop out of the element list and what is left is the page's links, buttons, inputs and list items with the usual `el_N` ids and action tags. A `Pages` section follows the scrollable list, one entry per browser window: the page document's id, title, URL, vertical scroll percent and the visible page text in document order — that text is what the page shows *now*, so text below the fold only appears after scrolling (scroll the page document by its id or its centre, then re-snapshot). The page document is a scroll target, never a clickable control. Firefox is not supported yet, and a page still loading has no document either: that window is walked whole and its `Pages` entry says so. Leave `use_dom` off for desktop apps — an Electron or WebView2 app is not a browser here.

`window(action:"list")` is still the right call when all you need is the window inventory — checking what is open before launching a second copy of an app that is already running, without paying for an element walk. It returns every user-visible top-level window in z-order (`ZOrder` 0 = frontmost) with `Title`, `Pid`/`ProcessName`, `State` (`Normal|Minimized|Maximized`), `Bounds` in virtual-desktop pixels, `IsActive`, `IsBrowser`, `MonitorIndex` into `multi_monitor`'s list (`-1` = on no monitor, e.g. minimized), and `DesktopId` — which virtual desktop the window is on (a lower-case GUID, `null` when Windows will not say). `window(action:"desktops")` names those GUIDs: `{"current": …, "all":[{Id, Name, Index, IsCurrent}]}`, so a window whose `DesktopId` is not the current one is open but on another desktop — that is the usual reason a window is listed yet nothing on screen matches it. Nothing switches or creates desktops; the inventory is read-only, and an empty `all` just means this build tells us nothing. `window(action:"active")` returns just the foreground window, or `{"found":false}`. **Target by `Title` or by `Hwnd`** — `switch_to_window`/`focus` and `window(action:"minimize"|"maximize"|"restore"|"close")` match a title exact, then substring, then fuzzy (score ≥ 70, so `"notepad"` finds `"Untitled - Notepad"`), and also accept the row's `Hwnd`, which wins over a title and never fuzzes; a title that matches nothing is an error listing the open windows, not a quiet `Success:false`. `find_element(scope:"window", window:…)` still matches exact-then-substring only — a walk must not fuzz. `switch_to_window`/`focus` return `{Window, MatchStrategy (exact|substring|fuzzy|hwnd), Score, Restored, Strategy, Success}`: a minimised window is restored first, then the tool climbs a `SetForegroundWindow` → `AttachThreadInput` → ALT-nudge ladder and re-reads the foreground window after each rung, so read `Success` (observed) and `Strategy` (which rung worked, `null` when none did) rather than assuming the call landed. Minimized windows are listed by default (`include_minimized:false` drops them); untitled ones are not (`include_hidden:true` adds them). Check `IsActive`/`State` before a `get_state` or a coordinate `click` — a backgrounded or minimized target is the usual cause of an empty tree.

**Open an app by the name a person would say it.** `launch("calc")`, `launch("vs code")`, `launch("edge")` — a path or an executable name that exists starts outright, and anything else is matched against an in-process catalog of Start Menu shortcuts and packaged (Store/MSIX) apps: exact, then prefix, then fuzzy (score ≥ 70). You do not need the path or the AUMID, and nothing spawns PowerShell. The call waits for the window by default (`wait_for_window:true`, `timeout_ms:10000`, 1–60000) and returns `{MatchedName, Kind (shortcut|packaged|path), Score, Strategy (path|exact|prefix|fuzzy), Pid, Hwnd, Title, WindowDetected}` — hand that `Hwnd` straight to `focus`/`switch_to_window`/`window` instead of guessing a title. **`WindowDetected:false` is not a failure:** the app was started (the `Pid` is real), the window just was not there in time or belongs to a process the activation never named — `wait` a second and re-read `window(action:"list")`, or raise `timeout_ms`. A name that matches nothing is an error listing the five nearest apps with their scores; read those rather than retrying the same string. Check `window(action:"list")` first when a second copy of an already-running app would be wrong.

**Arrange windows with `window(action:"set_bounds"|"move"|"resize")`.** `set_bounds` takes all four of `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`; `move` takes `x`,`y` and keeps the size; `resize` takes `width`,`height` and keeps the position — all in the same virtual-desktop pixels `window(action:"list")` and `multi_monitor` report, so tile against a monitor's `WorkArea` (the screen minus the taskbar), not its `Bounds`. Targeting is the usual `title`/`hwnd`, and with neither it acts on the foreground window. A minimized or maximized window is **refused naming its state** — add `restore_first:true` to restore it first and then place it. The move never raises or focuses the window (use `focus` for that), and the result's `After` is the rect re-read from the window afterwards: compare it with what you asked for instead of assuming, since a window with a minimum size will land somewhere else.

Prefer `interact_element` over a coordinate `click` for a named control: it acts through the UIA pattern (Invoke, SelectionItem, Toggle, Value) and falls back to a physical click at the element's centre, reports which one fired in `Method`, and errors — instead of silently doing nothing — when a pattern is unsupported. Keyboard chords go through `shortcut` (`ctrl+c`, `ctrl+shift+s`, `win+r`, `alt+f4`, a bare `win`); a single key through `key` (`a`, `enter`, `f5`). Coordinates for `click`/`drag`/`hover`/`scroll` are physical pixels on the virtual desktop with the origin at the primary monitor's top-left, so a monitor left of or above it has negative coordinates — take them from `multi_monitor` or an element's `Bounds`.

**Give the physical verbs the `el_N` id, not the numbers.** `click`, `type`, `scroll` and `drag` all take `element_id` in place of `x`/`y` and aim at that element's centre themselves, so the snapshot's ids flow straight into the action — and an element that has scrolled off-screen is refused by name and reason instead of clicking whatever now sits at those coordinates. Coordinates and `element_id` are mutually exclusive (giving both, or only one of `x`/`y`, is an error), and each response echoes the point it used plus `elementId`/`name`, so an action by id still says where it landed.

- **Fill a field in one call.** `type(text, element_id:<the edit>, clear:true, press_enter:true)` clicks the field, selects all and deletes, types, and presses Enter — the `click` → `shortcut("ctrl+a")` → `key("backspace")` → `type` → `key("enter")` round-trips collapse into one. `caret:"start"|"end"` moves the caret first (Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End) when you want to append rather than replace; `pace_ms` slows the keystrokes for an app that drops them. Newlines in `text` are pressed as Enter and tabs as Tab, so a multi-line block goes in as separate lines — strip them if the control is single-line and Enter would submit. Text of 200+ characters (with no other control characters) is **pasted** through the clipboard in one keystroke instead of typed; the previous clipboard text is put back afterwards and `method`/`clipboardRestored` in the result say what happened, so don't stage long text in the clipboard yourself.
- **`click(element_id:…)`** for a control that has no useful UIA pattern, and `click(element_id:…, clicks:0)` to park the pointer on it (a hover that reveals a tooltip or a menu) without pressing anything.
- **`scroll` needs no coordinates.** `scroll(direction:"down")` turns the wheel wherever the pointer already is; `scroll(direction:"down", element_id:<the scrollable row from the snapshot>)` scrolls that region; `x`/`y` still work. For sideways scrolling in an app that ignores the horizontal wheel, add `shift_wheel:true` to `left`/`right`. Re-snapshot afterwards: the scroll percentages, and every element's coordinates, have moved.
- **Fill several fields, or select several items, in one call.** `multi_edit(entries_json)` takes a JSON array of `{element_id}` or `{x,y}` objects each carrying `text` (plus optional `clear` and `press_enter`) and runs the `type` path on every one — a whole form in a single call. `multi_select(targets_json)` clicks a list of the same targets with **Ctrl held for the whole batch** (`ctrl:false` clicks without it), which is how several rows, files or canvas objects get selected at once. Both resolve *every* target before any input is sent, so an off-screen element refuses the batch with nothing done; both **stop at the first failure** and hand back `failedIndex`, `error` and the per-entry `results` so far — the batch is not atomic, so re-read the state before retrying instead of assuming all or nothing. Take every id from one `snapshot`: the next snapshot evicts them.
- **`drag` needs motion to be believed.** `drag(from_element_id:…, element_id:…)` (or coordinates) presses, nudges past the system drag threshold, moves through `steps` interpolated points over `duration_ms`, and releases — which is what file managers, canvases and browser drag-and-drop check for. Defaults are 300 ms over 20 steps; raise both (`duration_ms:800, steps:40`) for a target that ignores a fast drag. Omit the origin entirely and the drag starts at the current cursor.

`screenshot` hands back the picture **inline** — look at it, never ask for a file path. It captures the **primary display** by default; pass `display:"1"` (or `"all"`, `"0,2"` — indices from `multi_monitor`) for another monitor, or `region:"x,y,w,h"` in those same virtual-desktop pixels. Read the metadata text block that arrives with the image before acting on it: it carries the `region` actually captured, every monitor in `displays`, and the pointer in `cursor {x, y, monitorIndex}` — which is also painted on the image (`cursorDrawn` says whether that mark is the real cursor icon or the fallback ring; `include_cursor:false` turns it off). Captures are downscaled to fit 1920×1080, so on a 4K monitor image pixels are **not** desktop pixels: when the metadata carries a `note`, follow it literally (multiply by `coordinateScale`, add the region origin) before passing any coordinate to `click`/`drag`/`scroll`. `ocr` takes the same `region`/`display` and always reads at full resolution.

**If a capture comes back black, retry it with `backend:"wgc"`.** The default `auto` backend already prefers Windows.Graphics.Capture — the compositor's own frames, which show GPU-accelerated, hardware-overlay and DRM-protected surfaces (video players, some games, protected browser content) — and falls back to the classic GDI screen copy silently, so the metadata `backend` field (`"gdi"` or `"wgc"`) is what tells you which one you actually got. A black or stale-looking picture with `backend:"gdi"` is the case for asking for `"wgc"` explicitly; that form errors instead of falling back, which is the point. Note that every capture also draws an orange glow around the captured area for a few seconds on the user's screen — that is deliberate (they can see what was looked at), it is never in the image, and `flash: true` in the metadata just records that it was shown.

**`annotate:true` when you need to see *and* address the controls.** One call then returns three blocks — metadata, the same element rows `snapshot` prints (filtered to what the picture contains), then the image with a coloured box and a label chip around every interactive element in it. The chips are the snapshot's `el_N` ids, so label N in the picture is row N of that call's text block, and the id goes straight to `interact_element`/`click` without a second call. It costs a full desktop walk, so leave it off for a plain "what's on screen" look — and because that walk *is* a snapshot walk, it **evicts the ids the previous `snapshot` issued**. `grid_columns`/`grid_rows` (0–64, and usable without `annotate`) overlay evenly spaced guide lines captioned with **virtual-desktop** coordinates, not image pixels — the numbers you pass to `click` — which is the fallback when a target has no addressable element.

`find_element` searches the **foreground window** by default, resolved at call time. For anything multi-step, pass `scope:"window"` with `window:<title>` (matched exact-then-substring, so `"Notepad"` finds `"Untitled - Notepad"`) — then a notification or another app stealing focus cannot change what is searched, and a title that matches nothing lists the open windows so you can retry. `scope:"desktop"` searches every top-level window. Results are on-screen elements only and capped at 20 **after** filtering; pass `include_offscreen:true` to see collapsed panes, virtualised rows and minimised windows when diagnosing why something is missing. Use `kind:"interactive"` to find something to click **or type into** (buttons, menu items, list rows, tabs, combo boxes, sliders, and edit/document areas); `kind:"text"` is for reading. `wait_for`'s element conditions take the same filters and retry a poll that fails, so they are safe on a busy desktop.

`assert_element` checks exists / enabled / checked / visible / focused, and `value` with `expected` (an exact match against the element's ValuePattern value, else its Name). A `FAIL:` names what was observed — the focus owner, the actual value, the toggle state, or `element no longer available` when the window closed since the id was issued — so choose the next action from that instead of re-reading the tree.

### 5. File forensics

```
file_search (locate)
  → file_info (size/timestamps/attributes)
  → file_hash (SHA-256)
  → file_streams (alternate data streams)
  → verify_signature (Authenticode/catalog trust)
```

Locate the file(s) first, then layer on metadata, a hash suitable for IOC/VirusTotal lookups, a check for hidden alternate-data-stream payloads, and a signature/trust verdict. Useful both for vetting a suspicious binary found elsewhere (a process path, an autorun entry) and for general integrity checks.

## Safety rails & gotchas

- **Confirm before destructive tools:** `registry_set`, `registry_delete`, `service`, `scheduled_task`, `power_action`, `file_write`, `file_manage`, `firewall`. Each of these is gated behind a `confirm: true` parameter on the write/destructive path — treat that gate as a place to pause and get user sign-off, not just a required field to fill in. Run the read-only counterpart first: `registry_get` before `registry_set` or `registry_delete` (a key delete also needs `recursive: true` when the key has sub-keys, and the hive root and the profile/OS roots are refused outright); `process_inspect` before killing; `service` (status/list) before start/stop.
- **`storage_health` can wedge on external / USB drives.** Its default mode is fast and never wakes sleeping drives, but `include_usage: true` wakes sleeping/USB drives to collect SMART data — scope to internal disks by default, or warn the user before running it with `include_usage: true` against removable media.
- **Runs unelevated.** Admin-only operations (`registry_set` under `HKLM`, `service` start/stop, some `scheduled_task` actions) fail with access-denied. Surface that signature to the user; don't loop retrying.
- **UIAutomation tools need the target app foregrounded** on an interactive desktop — they fail headless or against a backgrounded window.
- **Multi-line PowerShell is passed whole.** The `powershell` tool sends the script as a single `-EncodedCommand` unit (temp-`.ps1` fallback only for oversized scripts), so heredocs and multi-line strings work as-is — no temp-file workaround is needed.
- **Long jobs are fine; disk-saturation storms are not.** A single long `powershell`/heavy tool call (>~120s — e.g. `DISM`, a big hash, a bulk delete) is safe: the Claude Code harness "moves it to the background" (benign) and the result is delivered on completion, and the server allows a 15-min PowerShell backstop (long foreground calls also emit MCP progress heartbeats so spec-compliant clients keep the request alive). What *does* break it is running several heavy ops (`DISM` + a `service` stop + bulk deletes) **while the disk is already saturated** by a concurrent large hash/copy — the MCP call can fail transiently with `"An error occurred invoking 'powershell'"`. That is **I/O starvation, not a timeout or a 120s limit** (verified 2026-07-17: lone 150s and two concurrent ~135s calls all succeeded; the only failures came during a 42 GB SHA-256 storm, with no server crash). Mitigation: for the heaviest/longest ops (installers, `DISM`, big hashes), prefer `powershell` with `background: true` — it returns a job id immediately and runs outside the serialization gate; poll with the `job` tool (`status`/`output`/`cancel`/`list`). Claude Code's own `run_in_background` remains a fallback, and don't stack heavy windows-mcp ops during a saturation storm. Raising `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` is **not** the fix — its default is ~28 h, not 120s.
