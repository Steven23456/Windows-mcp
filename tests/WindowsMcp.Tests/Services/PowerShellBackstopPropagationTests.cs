/// F8: the execution backstop is LOUD for the callers that never asked for a clock.
/// <para>
/// Every PowerShell-backed service — disk, storage, security, firewall, network, audio, file
/// streams, notification — calls <c>RunAsync(command, ct)</c>, the overload with no timeout
/// argument, and therefore has no <c>TimedOut</c> flag to read. When the 15-minute backstop tears
/// down a wedged script, <c>PowerShellService</c> throws a <see cref="TimeoutException"/> (proved
/// against the real process in <see cref="PowerShellServiceTests"/>); these rows prove the other
/// half — that each service lets it through to the caller instead of parsing the empty stdout of a
/// killed child into a confident, wrong answer. <c>disk_inspect mode:reclaimable</c> is the
/// standing example of what a swallowed failure costs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Mocked deliberately: no real script can be made to hang for fifteen minutes in a unit suite, and
/// what is under test here is each service's own reaction, not PowerShell's.
